sss 0.1.9000
---------

This release contains very minor changes to comply with CRAN policies.

* Don't use `LazyData`, since the package doesn't contain data


Other changes

* The function `read.sss()` has a new argument `verbose = FALSE` that suppresses any messages.  If you want the messages, set `verbose = TRUE`


sss 0.1.2 (2020-09-18)
---------

* This release fixes two issues that might introduce unintended consequences:
  - dealing with embedded <text> tags (#9)
  - dealing with self-closing tags (#10)
* Tests conform to `testthat_3.0.0`


sss 0.1.1 (2020-08-11)
---------

* Mostly small cosmetic changes to keep the package up to date.
* `read.sss()` will now also guess `*.dat` files for the data, in addition to `*.csv` and `*.asc`


sss 0.1-0 (2017-03-28)
---------

* You can now specify only the .sss file in `read.sss()`, and the function 
  will guess the name of the .asc
* Added `label.table` attribute
* Internal changes:
  - Imports `xml2` instead of `XML`
  - Better error checking using `assert_that()`

sss 0.0-07 (2011-10-30)
